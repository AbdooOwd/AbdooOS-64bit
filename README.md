# AbdooOS-64bit

AbdooOS is an Operating System made for fun with love and *"sanity loss"*
by me, a dumb 15 years old (: . The general goal is to make an all purpose OS that anybody can use.
The **real** goal is to learn how a computer works and provide useful
resources and examples for people who want to do like me.

# The Idea

The idea is to provide a project that can be used by devs/students and users.
Devs could use this project as an example for learning or developing their own OS.
It can also be used by students to learn about OS Development in one place,
thanks to all the `*.md` files I've written to explain how the OS works.

# My Resources

I've written some stuff so people can learn about OS Development.
There is that document I wrote called [**"How it works"**](./docs/how-it-works.md).
There's also some [**notes*](./docs/notes.md) that aren't really useful, they're
just notes I wrote so I remind myself of a few things.

# Resources I used

My goal was to understand computers. So of course, I had to understand what 
I was doing.  You might see some code that I just copy-pasted, but I did 
try to understand before **[ctrl+c ctrl+v]**'ing.

So I used a lot of resource:

-   [The NanoByte OS Development Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFjM7v6KGMpiH2G-kT781ByCNC_0pKpPN) 
    *(EXTREMLY useful! Explains theory, practical and everything else!).*

-   [The BrokenThornEntertainment OSDev series](http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html)
    *(**WARNING:** this resource should be used to generally understand OSDev.*
    *It shouldn't be used to make a real OS because of its errors and difficulty.*
    *But it is really explanatory.)*

-   [OliveStem's OSDev series](https://www.youtube.com/@olivestemlearning)
    *(Really good to understand with actual coding, not only theory)*.

-   Of course, the [OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org).

-   [MmdOS GitHub repo](https://github.com/Rostamborn/MmdOS)
    *(really helped me to actually see theory applied into code)*.
